In the exec_environment folder you have the match_runner which builds all of the matches.  The tournament_runner builds a tournament and calls to make all of the matches within it.  The check_for folders are ran to check for any match or tournament with the status of “waiting”.  
Besides that, everything for challenges and tournaments will be in your typical MVC setup.
