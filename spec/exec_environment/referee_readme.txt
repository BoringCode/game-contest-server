Currently to be a referee you must:

1. Accept a port through the '-p' command line argument

2. Accept a number of players per game through '-n' command line argument

2. Use that port to send the port number you want your clients to connect on

3. Send us the game result for each player in the form... "PlayerName|Result|Score"
    - an example would be... Bob|Win|5
